# WagSyncAI: The Ultimate Dog Parenting Assistant

## Project Overview
WagSyncAI is an AI-powered application designed to assist dog owners in managing their pets' health, training, nutrition, and social interactions. Currently, the project is in the development phase with a focus on frontend design. The backend development will follow to fully integrate all planned features.

## Current Progress
- **Frontend Design**: The frontend of WagSyncAI has been designed using Figma. The wireframes and prototypes reflect the planned functionality of the app, focusing on user-friendly navigation and engaging interfaces.
- **Technologies Used**: Figma for UI/UX design.
- **Features Prototyped**:
  - Health monitoring and medical record management.
  - AI-guided training schedules.
  - Nutritional planning and tracking.
  - Social features for community engagement among dog owners.

## Upcoming Developments
- **Backend Integration**: Future developments will include setting up the backend using technologies such as Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to handle data management, AI functionalities, and user interactions.
- **Feature Implementation**: Gradual implementation of the interactive features prototyped in the frontend.

## How to Contribute
- Feedback on the current UI/UX is highly welcome.
